# P-22-VR4M
VR4M is a simulation system for military trainees. 
Problem Statement: Keeping in mind the limited availability of weapons and the requirement of hands-on training it is imperative that a simulation testing system is developed so that the trainees can be prepared for actual weapon utilization.
VR4M will ease the gap between theoretical learning and practical application by virtual environments and interactive weapon models with augmented reality functionality and prepare them for real combat practice as well as test their fitness for actual weapon usage.
